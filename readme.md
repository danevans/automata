# Cellular Automata

This renders a grid of dots populated by characters. Each character is represented by a letter of the alphabet and a color. Every "tick" each character moves in a random direction on the board. When they reach an edge they wrap around to the other side.

## TODO

- characters interacting with each other
- characters moving intentionally
- characters aging and dying
